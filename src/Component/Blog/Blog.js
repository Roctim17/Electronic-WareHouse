                        <h5> Differences between sql and nosql databases?</h5>
                        <p>
                            1. SQL databases are relational And NoSQL databases are non-relational.
                            2. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
                            3. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions And NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
                            4. SQL databases are vertically scalable And NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
                            5.SQL databases are table-based And NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

                        <p>
                            jwt is an open standard used to share security information between two parties a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
                            JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.
